<p><strong><i>Sweet sixteen</i></strong><i> is all about Aliya who was the only child of her parents. She turned out to have good rapport with both of her parents but that of her father was intense. Aliya was in her penultimate year in the senior secondary school grade when she clocked 15. Waiting eagerly to be 16 is her priority because she had read a book titled sweet sixteen.
Aliya had to constantly remind her father that she is not a child but a 'young adult'. He does not always agree with her. But  now that she is turning sixteen, he is sitting up and taking notice. The expected birthday card from him replaced by a present and a no holds barred letter - a page for each year she <br /> has lived. It chronicles, the lessons and the wisdom he has attempted to pass to her,
and unburdens the burning questions she has about life. Aliya questions who she is and why she is; with her father as a guide on her journey of discovery.</i>
</p>
<!--Brief introduction to the book-->
<p><i>Couple of things fascinated me with this book ranging from its way it dealt with the common stereotype lived by young people out there, it also talked about some form of ways of proferring solutions using some intellectual works, by that,
I mean the book uses some scholar usage of words which I shall cite in the subsequent paragraphs.</i></p>
<p><i>Although the book  was all about a small girl who had a good relationship with her parents yet it makes a good observation on what is going on in our society. Part of what the book talked about was a nice qoute from <b>KHALIL GIBRAN</b>, from his book <strong>The prophet</strong> which goes thus:
<blockquote>
"Your children are not your children.
They are the sons and daughters of life's longing for itself.
They come through you but not from you,
And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.
You may give them your love but not your thoughts.You may house their bodies, but not their souls,
For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.
You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.
For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday"
</blockquote>
This quote made it understandable that our children only came from us yet we cannot control whom they ought to be, they should be in the future, what they should choose as a course of study in schools! Khalil Gibran explained in his book futher, that our children have some rights over us as a parent which we also have over them in return, but we should not seek to make them what we believe in that they should be rather we should support them in whatever good they do and correct them if otherwise. This is not just an eye opener, it also guides some parents who are stern in choosing career paths for their wards. Our children owns their right to become anybody they had envisaged to be come the nearest future! Says the quote of Khalil Gibran.

<P>
<i>Another thing about the book was the usage of <strong>Alfred Lord Tennyson's</strong> Ulysses; one of the greatest poems ever, he is an Englishman <blockquote>"That which we are, we are; one equal temper of heroic hearts, made weak by time and fate, but strong in will. To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield".</blockquote> This qoute was actually adopted as the motto for the 2012 summer Olympics in London. "To strive,to seek, to find, and not to yield"</i>

Another intriguing aspect of the book is the story Aliya's father told her about transfering and paying her debt by taking good morals to her coming generations. The story goes thus:
once upon a time, there was a hunter who lived in a remote village somewhere in Africa. One day, he went on a hunting expedition, promising his family that he would come back with assorted game, so they could have a feast.
However, after stalking the forest for several days and several nights, there was no game in sight. He thought that perhaps, if he went farther into the forest, he would get lucky. The farther he went the more he became afraid. He ran out of water. He soon began to starve. But lack of food did not worry him as much as lack of water. Yet, he kept pushing on deeper into the forest. Hunting for game was no longer his priority; he was desperately in need of water, but his food was down also so he needed food too. But he began to hallucinate and he feared that he might die. well, dying to him was his last hope but he needed some form of shelter to lay his head and die so that wild animmals would not feast on his body. As he stood swaying on one spot, drunk with thirst and hunger, he suddenly saw a narrow path that he did not notice before. He thought he was hallucinating but he managed to follow the path, he saw a signboard that said , 'Food is Ready.' As if that was not intriguing enough, underneath the sighnboard was written, 'All you can eat for free, your ancestors have paid for your food.'
</i></p>
<p><i>
He managed to get to the spot, he trudged towards the direction that the signboard ponted and he soon found himself in a big compound. Everyone happened to be busy, dedicated to the affairs of the stomach. As the fermished hunter stood bewildered, he could not help but think he had arrived heaven! A lot of activities were going on, some were pounding yam, some were cooking the soup, some were fetching rice into a large pot. And some were busy skinning  freshly killed game of different stripes. He was still trying to make sense of what he saw when two beautiful ladies walked towards him with two crystal jugs of what looked like milk . In all his entire life, he had never beheld such enchanting beauty. The two ladies led him to a room and sat him on a cushion, so soft, softer than any he had ever sat on. They enquired about what he would love to eat. Even in his excitement, he had major concern. He had no money. How would he pay for the food and the drinks? He could not be sure now that he actually saw it on the signboard that it's free! He enquired again from the ladies attending to him, 'Is it true, what I saw outside, that food is free because my ancestors had paid?' They confirmed that it was true.
</i></p>
<p><i>
All glory to his ancestors! He asked them to give him anything they had. They soon return with a mountain of pounded yam, assorted game meat and chilled juices of different fruits held in sweating crystal jugs. The hunter finished the whole food he also drank the juice, he ate his fill. It was the most delicious food he ever had in his entire life. He thank the profusely, as a new wave of tranquilty swept over him, he slept off. They asked if he enjoyed the meal. He said he did so, he wondered if he could take some along for the road. They told him he could take as many he liked. So he loaded his back pack with some heavy load of food as he began to proceed he heard the voice 'gentleman you have not paid.' What was this? He wondered. 'But, I was told I could have anything for free because my parents had paid.' 'Yes,' the voice answered. 'And you have done just that.' But the reason you were able to enjoy the free meal that you just had was that someone else had paid. "You too must pay, so that your children coming after you would also enjoy a free meal, someday like you just did."
</i></p>
<p><i>In conclusion, sweet sixteen is a cool book for both young and adult especially those in their youthful age it takes into consideration basics things that goes viral in our society using some scholars litrary works. It talks about some other things happening in Nigeria at the time ranging from the extremist Islamic group i.e Boko Haram, and that of the hunter story all in one book. Sweet sixteen is a great book to read!</i></p>
